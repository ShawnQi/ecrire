# The controller handles user authentication, and CSRF protection.

# It also provides a +url+ method to build complex URL using a

  # Returns a URL based on the path and options provided.
  # It does not try to validate the URL, it only generates it and assume
  # it's a valid URL.
  #
  # +path+: The relative path of the URL you want to build.
  #
  # +options+: Hash containing options for rendering the url.
  #
  #
  # The +path+ and +options+ are linked together via a mapping construct
  # that you can use to map records to part of the URL.
  #
  # To map records to the +path+, you need to specify the record & the method you want to use inside the path.
  #
  #   url('/admin/posts/:posts.id', post: @post) 
  #   ->Â '/admin/posts/32'
  #
  # The method looks for every occurence of ":[key].[method]" and will look in +options+ for that key and call the given method on that key.
  #
  # This means the object can be anything as long as it handles the method.
  #
  # Here are a other examples:
  #
  #   url('/users/:user.id/tags/:tag.id/', user: @user, tag: @tag)
  #   -> '/users/12/tags/12'
  #
  #   url('/users')
  #   -> '/users'
  #
  # The +options+ also looks for the +absolute_path+ key. If it's set to +true+, the
  # method will return an absolute path.
  #
  #   url('/users/:user.id/tags/:tag.id/', user: @user, tag: @tag, absolute_path: true)
  #   -> 'http://localhost:3000/users/12/tags/12'
  #
  #   url('/users', absolute_path: true)
  #   -> 'http://localhost:3000/users'
